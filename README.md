# rokuprojectcode

There are 2 places which files are orginized:

Features
and
Project

Features will be small demos of features to be used in the project, which will be posted by individuals as deadlines come up

Project code puts the features together into one orginized class system for ideal display and logic, each feature integrated. Make sure to not put features in project code files.

only put features here. Make sure each one is named and formatted correctly and it its own folder. To add folders in github, click add files,
At the top of the screen to the right of the "rokuprojectcode/features/" name your folder and add another slash. After this, make your readme file (.md)
So that github knows its making a folder and not just a file. good luck!
